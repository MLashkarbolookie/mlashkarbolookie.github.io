      <strong> Prosocial Disclosure and Contracts </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies prosocial disclosure (e.g., ESG reporting) and prosocial contracts (e.g., sustainability-linked loans) in a multitasking principalâ€“agent framework with limited liability and private agent types. The agent exerts costly effort on two tasks: one yielding an unverifiable outcome and another producing an outcome that can be verifiably disclosed at a cost. The agentâ€™s private type reflects intrinsic utility over the outcomes, shaping both partiesâ€™ gains from contracting on the verifiable information. The main result is the ambiguous effect of mandatory disclosure regulation. While a disclosure mandate can enhance prosocial effort and welfare when the voluntary regime yields non-disclosure, it can reduce contracting efficiency and welfare when full disclosure arises voluntarily. When voluntary disclosure is partial, mandatory disclosure can either improve or undermine efficiency and welfare, depending on the complementarity of the outcomes for the principal and the agents, and on the extent of the principalâ€™s free-riding when contracting with intrinsically motivated agents.    </p>
