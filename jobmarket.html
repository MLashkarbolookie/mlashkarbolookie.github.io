      <strong> Prosocial Disclosure and Contracts </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies prosocial disclosure (e.g., ESG reporting) and prosocial contracts (e.g., sustainability-linked loans) in a multitasking principalâ€“agent framework with limited liability and private agent types. The agent exerts costly effort on two tasks: one yielding an unverifiable outcome and another generating an outcome that can be verifiably disclosed at a cost. The agentâ€™s private type captures their intrinsic utility over the outcomes, which affects both parties' gain from contracting on the verifiable information. The main result is the ambiguous effect of a mandatory disclosure regulation. While such a mandate can enhance prosocial effort and welfare when the voluntary regime yields non-disclosure, it can reduce welfare when full disclosure emerges voluntarily. When voluntary disclosure is partial, mandatory disclosure can either improve or undermine contracting efficiency and welfare, depending on the specification of agent types and the principalâ€™s objective.
